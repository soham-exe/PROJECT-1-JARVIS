Voice-Controlled Jarvis
Voice-Controlled Jarvis is a Python project that allows you to interact with your computer using voice commands. Inspired by the fictional AI assistant from the Iron Man movies, this project aims to create a simple voice-controlled system.

Features
Trigger Word Detection: The program listens for a specific trigger word (e.g., “jarvis”) to activate voice commands.
Speech Recognition: Utilizes the Google Web Speech API to recognize spoken commands.
Voice-Controlled Actions: Execute various actions based on recognized commands.

Usage
Launch the program.
Say “jarvis” to activate voice control.
Issue commands (e.g., “What’s the weather today?” or “Open browser”).
